		<p>A map that I had made, which is also my first map, it is basically a 
		parkour map made for Duke Nukem Forever Restoration Project and has something you'd see 
		in those surf/jump maps in Team Fortress 2. More info about the map can 
		be found in the <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a> page.</p>

		<p>This was actually sold in the stores in the 90's in stores and 
		basically most of the sharewares that you had found in stores were not 
		made by id Software except for the game, obviously. The sellers of this 
		wad file did something special and decided to put some sound files from 
		movies (most of them are from mafia genre) and rest of the gameplay 
		remains intact though.
