		<p>This is my first map that I have ever made, this map can be played in 
		<a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/dnf2001-restoration-project">Duke Nukem Forever Restoration Project</a> build of the game and this game 
		uses the rope mechanics of the game and incorporates it with parkour 
		maps found in other games like TF2/CS:S or Minecraft's parkour maps. You 
		can find the file in <a href="downloads.html">Downloads</a>, or in
		<a href="https://dnfmaps.com/download/parkour-ropes/">dnfmaps.com</a></p>

		<p class="auto-style12"><em>DukeEd.com</em></p>
		<p>DukeEd.com was a site that was a fansite of Duke Nukem Forever and it 
		was made by some Unreal Engine 1-based modders to make a community for 
		the upcoming Duke Nukem Forever, but as DNF got delayed more and more, 
		the site became an obscurity as no one visited there, and the owner had 
		to close it in 17th May of 2001, as it was sold to GameSpy (an old 
		popular multiplayer host that got defunct later).
		<a href="https://dukeed.netlify.app">DukeEd.com</a>'s goal is to give 
		the website the a proper archive of the old one and a new website that 
		has the look and feel of the original one, but has frequent new updates 
		and news of Duke Nukem related projects like the Restoration Project or 
		the DNF Enhanced.</p>
